# Texture Analysis and Image Feature Extraction using SIFT

In this assignment, we focus on implementing texture classification and segmentation algorithms based on the 5x5 Laws filters. Additionally, we implement Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) based on paper `Lowe, David G. "Object recognition from local scale-invariant features." iccv. Ieee, 1999.`. SIFT is an image feature extractor which is useful for representing the image information in a low dimensional form.
