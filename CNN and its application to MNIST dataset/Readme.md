# MNIST Digit Classification using LeNet5

LeNet-5 is the first Convolutional Neural Network proposed by Yann Lecun, Yoshua bengio, Leon Bottou and Patrick Haffner in 1990’s for purpose of handwritten or machine printed character recognition. Now, it is being used as a foundation for classifying or recognizing image of any categories – such as digits, cars, deer, airplane, ship, etc. This project is focussed on applying LeNet-5 network to classify handwritten digits. Further, we also analyze the performance of the network by applying it to negative of digit images
